Relay is forked  code from the Sphinx protocol. It is a Node.js wrapper around LND, handling connectivity and storage for N2N2. Communication between Relay nodes takes place entirely on the Lightning Network, so it is decentralized, untraceable, and encrypted. Message content is also end-to-end encrypted using client public keys, on the  N2N2 app itself.

Relay stores:
* Aliases
* Messages
* Recurring payment configurations
* Invites (so you can add your friends)
* Media Keys: keys for decrypting media files, asymmetrically encrypted for each contact in a chat
